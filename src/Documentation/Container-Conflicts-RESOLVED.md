# ?? Docker Container Conflicts - RESOLVED!

## ? **Issue Resolution Status**

### **Problem Solved** ?
The Docker container conflicts with `eshop-seq`, `eshop-identity`, and other eShop containers have been **completely resolved**.

### **What Was Done**
1. ? **Removed all conflicting containers** - All 7 eShop containers successfully removed
2. ? **Cleaned up orphaned resources** - Container and network cleanup completed
3. ? **Enhanced cleanup scripts** - Improved `cleanup-docker.bat` with better error handling
4. ? **Created quick-fix script** - `quick-fix.bat` for immediate conflict resolution
5. ? **Created service starter** - `start-services.bat` for easy service startup

## ?? **Ready to Start Services**

### **Option 1: Use the Service Starter (Recommended)**
```cmd
start-services.bat
```
This script will:
- Find your docker-compose.yml automatically
- Validate the configuration 
- Start all services with proper error handling
- Show service status and available endpoints

### **Option 2: Manual Docker Compose**
Navigate to your project root directory (where docker-compose.yml is located) and run:
```cmd
docker-compose up -d
```

### **Option 3: Enhanced Cleanup + Start**
```cmd
cleanup-docker.bat
```
This comprehensive script will:
- Remove any remaining conflicts
- Clean up resources
- Validate configuration
- Start services
- Perform health checks

## ?? **File Locations & Navigation**

Your project structure:
```
C:\Manoj\eshop-modular-monoliths\
??? src\                          # ? You might be here
??? docker-compose.yml             # ? Services definition (project root)
??? cleanup-docker.bat             # ? Enhanced cleanup script
??? start-services.bat             # ? Service starter script  
??? quick-fix.bat                  # ? Emergency conflict resolver
??? ...
```

**Important**: Make sure to run Docker commands from the directory containing `docker-compose.yml` (usually the project root).

## ?? **Expected Service Endpoints**

Once services are running, you'll have access to:

| Service | URL | Credentials |
|---------|-----|-------------|
| **eShop API** | http://localhost:8080 | N/A |
| **Health Check** | http://localhost:8080/health | N/A |
| **Swagger UI** | http://localhost:8080/swagger | N/A |
| **API Info** | http://localhost:8080/ | N/A |
| **pgAdmin** | http://localhost:5050 | admin@eshop.com / admin123 |
| **Keycloak** | http://localhost:8082 | admin / admin123 |
| **RabbitMQ** | http://localhost:15672 | guest / guest |
| **Seq Logs** | http://localhost:5341 | N/A |

## ?? **Useful Commands for Development**

### **Check Service Status**
```cmd
docker-compose ps
```

### **View Logs**
```cmd
# All services
docker-compose logs

# Specific service
docker-compose logs -f eshop-api
docker-compose logs -f identity
```

### **Restart Services**
```cmd
# Restart all
docker-compose restart

# Restart specific service
docker-compose restart eshop-api
```

### **Stop Services**
```cmd
docker-compose down
```

### **Rebuild After Code Changes**
```cmd
docker-compose up -d --build eshop-api
```

## ??? **Scripts Summary**

### **1. `cleanup-docker.bat` - Enhanced Cleanup**
- ? Comprehensive container removal
- ? Path detection and validation
- ? Configuration validation
- ? Service startup with health checks
- ? Detailed error reporting

### **2. `start-services.bat` - Smart Starter**  
- ? Automatic docker-compose.yml detection
- ? Configuration validation
- ? Service startup with status reporting
- ? Endpoint information display

### **3. `quick-fix.bat` - Emergency Resolver**
- ? Fast container conflict resolution
- ? No dependencies on file paths
- ? Cleanup of orphaned resources

## ?? **Next Steps**

1. **Start Your Services**:
   ```cmd
   start-services.bat
   ```

2. **Verify Services Are Running**:
   - Check: http://localhost:8080/health
   - Should return: `{"status":"Healthy"}`

3. **Access Your API**:
   - Main API: http://localhost:8080
   - Swagger: http://localhost:8080/swagger

4. **Begin Development**:
   - Your .NET 8 eShop Modular Monolith is ready!
   - All infrastructure services are running
   - Database migrations should be applied automatically

## ?? **If You Need Help**

### **Common Issues & Solutions**

1. **Services Won't Start**:
   ```cmd
   docker-compose logs
   ```

2. **Port Conflicts**:
   - Check if other applications are using ports 8080, 5432, 6379, etc.
   - Stop conflicting applications or change ports in docker-compose.yml

3. **Database Connection Issues**:
   - Wait 2-3 minutes for services to fully initialize
   - Check logs: `docker-compose logs eshop-db`

4. **Cannot Access Endpoints**:
   - Verify services are running: `docker-compose ps`
   - Check Docker Desktop is running
   - Wait for health checks to pass

## ?? **Success!**

Your Docker container conflicts have been resolved, and you now have:
- ? **Clean Docker environment** with no conflicts
- ? **Enhanced management scripts** for easy operations  
- ? **Ready-to-use eShop infrastructure** 
- ? **Comprehensive documentation** for ongoing development

Your .NET 8 eShop Modular Monolith is now ready for development! ??
